    <p class="simple">1. <b>Lever</b> Imagine a seesaw in the playground. When you push down on one side, the other side goes up. That's a lever! It helps lift things with less effort. <br>
    <br> 2. <b>Wheel and Axle:</b> Think of your bicycle. The wheels help it move along the road smoothly and quickly. The center part that the wheel spins around is called the axle. <br><br>
3. <b>Pulley:</b> Have you ever seen a flagpole with a rope used to raise and lower the flag? That's a pulley. It helps lift things up easily.<br><br>
4. <b>Inclined Plane:</b> This is just a fancy word for a ramp. Instead of lifting something straight up, you can push it up a ramp. This needs less force than lifting it straight up. <br><br>
5. <b>Wedge: </b> A wedge is like a sharp knife or an axe. When you push a wedge into something, like when you chop wood or cut your food, it splits things apart.<br><br>
6. <b>Screw: </b> A screw looks like a twisty metal pin. When you turn a screw into wood, it  holds things together tightly. Turning the screw makes it move forward and grip into the material.</p>

<h3 class="titl1">Pill Bugs</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="flex">
        <p class="simple">1. <b>Egg:</b> The life cycle of a pill bug starts when the female pill bug lays eggs. She carries these eggs in a special pouch under her body, which keeps them safe and moist. This pouch is called a marsupium. <br><br>
        2. <b>Birth: </b> After about 3 to 7 weeks, the eggs hatch directly into tiney versions of adult pill bugs, right inside the marsupium. These little pill bugs are white and very small. <br><br>
    3. <b>Juvenile Stage: </b> Once they leave the pouch, the young pill bugs, called juveniles, are on their own. They look like the tiny adults but will go through several molts as they grow. Molting is when they shed their outer skin to allow for their bodies to get bigger. Juveniles are usally more pale and gradually darken with each molt. <br><br>
4. <b> Adult:</b> After several molts over a period of about 2 to 6 months, the juveniles mature into adults. Adults are darker and have a harder outer shell. They can start reproducing and continuing the cycle of life. <br><br>
5. <b>Reproduction: </b> Adult pill bugs can mate and reproduce multiple times throughout multiple times throughout their life, which usually lasts around two years.
6. Pill bugs are interesting because they help break down dead plants and recycle nutrients back into the soil, making them important little creatures in our ecosystem!</p>
